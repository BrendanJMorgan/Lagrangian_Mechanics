# Lagrangian_Mechanics
Orbital mechanics in Mathematica done using lagrangian mechanics

This was made as part of an analytic mechanics course; all of the internal logic uses Lagrangian mechanics rather than traditional Newtonian mechanics. 
"Solar System.nb" plots and animates the motions of the sun and eight planets using accurate ephemerides.
"Orbital Precession.nb" finds the component of the precession of Mercury resulting from the influence of the other seven planets.
"Three Body Problem.nb" animates a spacecraft flying by the moon for a gravity assist, and plots the exact increase in energy resulting from this.
